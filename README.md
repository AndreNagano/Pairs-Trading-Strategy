# Pairs Trading Strategy

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook with a implementation of the Pairs Trading algorithm for trading cointegrated assets. It contains four separate sections:

- Pairs Trading: a brief introduction to the logic and key concepts behind the strategy.
- Data Analysis: looking for potential candidates listed in Brazil's Bovespa Index, while performing cointegration and stationarity tests.
- Data Visualization: time series plots to verify the mean reverting tendencies of the spread gap.
- Strategy Simulation: simulate a Pairs Trading strategy using real-world data.
